        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Emanuele Franchi and I am a programmer!
        </p>
        <p>
            I first started learning about programming and computer science when I started studying computer engineering at university, in Pavia, in 2016.
            Amongst the many first semester courses, there was one in particular that caught my attention.
            It was a course that taught the basics of how a computer works, on a low level perspective.
            After that I learnt my first programming language: C.
            There, I also took courses on operating systems, data bases and object oriented programming.
            Course after course, I started to realize my deep appreciation for computer science as a subject.
            This led me to move to another university, in Turin, to start my computer science degree, in 2018.
            The courses I had the most fun with talked about algorithms and data structures, automata theory and compilers, formal methods, functional programming and lambda calculus.
        </p>
        <p>
            After three beautiful years of studying, in April 2022, I finally graduated getting the highest score, 110L, doing a lab thesis on the Vulkan graphics API.
